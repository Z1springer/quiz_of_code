# quiz_of_code

This is a small quiz that we were instructed to build using "vanilla" JavaScript (no jquery). In it; we are told to make each question appear on the page one at a time. Then when choosing an answer it then takes you to the next question. If you answer correctly it is SUPPOSED to add on 10 seconds to the built in timer, should you answer incorrectly then it is SUPPOSED to take away 10 seconds from the timer. And your final score is whatever time you have left. I chose to make my quiz about Star Trek as it seemed the most fitting considering it is just as confusing as programming to any outside observer. I did run into some difficulties in formatting the timer correctly and setting up the final score board, as most of the examples I found to try and assist me through it were mainly written in jquery. This is the best that I can do given the allotted time. I can only apologise.
